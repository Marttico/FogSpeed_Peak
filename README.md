# FogSpeed

This mod does what it says on the tin! You can speed up or slow down the fog speed.

NOTE: Due to fog speed not being a parameter that gets synced between server and vanilla client, the fog may move jittery for clients without this mod installed. This is why it is recommended to have everyone in the session install this mod.

[Thunderstore page](https://thunderstore.io/c/peak/p/TeamCo/FogSpeed/)

Default keybinds:

- `J` Slow down Fog
- `K` Pause fog
- `L` Speed up Fog
- `I` Advance fog
- `O` Change fog direction

Config parameters:

- Default fog speed (By default `0.3`)


Special thanks to Pedguin for the idea for this mod!
