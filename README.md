# FogSpeed

This mod does what it says on the tin! You can speed up or slow down the fog speed.

NOTE: Due to fog speed not being a parameter that gets synced between server and vanilla client, the fog may move jittery for clients without this mod installed. This is why it is recommended to have everyone in the session install this mod.

Default keybinds:

- `J` Slow down fog
- `K` Pause fog
- `L` Speed up fog
- `I` Advance fog
- `O` Change fog direction
- `U` Reset fog speed to default

Config parameters:

- Default fog speed (By default `0.3`)
